# Code of Conduct

The `r params_custom$collab_long` (henceforth referred to as the "`r params_custom$collab_short`") is dedicated to providing a **harrassment-free experience** for participants at our event.  The `r params_custom$collab_short` is an informal, community-led hackathon intended for prefessional networking and collaboration in the R community.

An inclusive space free of harrassment encourages interaction among diverse groups.  We want to **make certain our event is welcoming and encourages participants to be involved** moving forward.
