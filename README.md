# introslides

This is a fun project that aims to convert existing R collab introduction slides from Google Slides to [`{xaringan}`](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1)!   While still very much a work in progress, this has great potential to become a full-fledged R package to wrap a template and give the user simple ways to customize.

## Local setup

This repository uses the [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package management system to help create a reproducible development environment.  Once you clone the repository, you can simply run the function `renv::restore()` to get the packages installed into your local `renv` library.  Please file an issue on this repository if you have any problems with that procedure.
